# CS126-SI-Practice
This repository contains exercises that have been done during Supplimental
Instruction.
Each PDF lists exercises that can be attempted; there is a .py file with the
same name as the PDF that contains my solution. My solution is not the only
solution to each problem, it's just how I went about solving it; as long as your
solution produces the expected out put, it should be fine.
